# Description: This script auto-loads WatirWorks modules and contains includes
#              for some Ruby/Watir libraries commonly needed by WatirWorks.
#
# Prerequisites: Ruby1.8.7, Watir1.9.x
#
# Instructions: Add the following entry to each of your test script files :
#                  require 'watirworks'
#
#               To access a WatirWorks methods or functions from your test script file either use:
#
#                  A) The full name syntax of <module>::<object> for the WatirWorks method, function or object.
#                       Where
#                          <module> is the name of the Module containing the object
#                          <object> is a class, method, array, hash or other object to be used
#
#                       For example, to access the state abbreviations from the WatirWorks Reference library:
#                          sMyFullStateName = WatirWorks_RefLib:USPS_StateAbbreviation["CO"]
#
#                  B) (RECOMENDED) Within each of your test script files add an entry for
#                      any WartirWorks module you're using.  For example:
#                        	include WatirWorks_RefLib
#
#                Then access the objects in that WatirWorks module by only specifying its relative name.
#                    sMyFullStateName = USPS_StateAbbreviation["CO"]

#  Use ruby's auto-load capabilities to associate a module name with the proper file to load.
#  Files will be loaded upon first 'include' statement for the associated module within your test file.
#  If you are NOT using a specific WatirWorks module you may comment out that modules entry, but its not really necessary
#  as by using ruby's autoload capability it has no effect unless the module is included.
