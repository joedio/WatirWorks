These files are examples using the search engine sites, Google, Bing, and Ask.
They read data from the Excel workbook (RunControl_Data.xls) in the data folder.         

Edit the ENV spreadsheet in the workbook to change which of the web sites to test against.
See the spreadsheet for additional information.

This folder contains three data driven test files.
	An Access test:             Example_Search_Access_test.rb
	An Entity Validation test: Example_Search_EntityVal_test.rb
	A Workflow test:           Example_Search_Flow_test.rb

Each test can be run by itself or they can be run together
as a test suite:                   Example_Search_testsuite.rb
