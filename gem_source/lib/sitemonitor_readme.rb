== Summary:

The Site Monitor is a data driven program that can be user configured to monitor
multiple Web sites for accessibility, and send an email notifications if any of
the specified sites is inaccessible.

It uses WatirWorks methods to determine if each site is accessible, and records results to a log file.
If a site is not accessible an email is generated and sent to the specified email accounts associated with that site, via the user specified SMTP server.
Data for the script is read from an Excel workbook which the user updated with information for:
* The Web sites to monitor
* The email server's access information
* The email accounts to contact when a web site is inaccessible

=== Files:

* site_monitor.rb      - The main program that reads the configuration file,
  performs the web site monitoring, and sends email's when a monitored site is down.
* site_monitor.bat     - A Windows batch file you can use to launch the site_monitor.rb
  script manually or as a Scheduled Task
* age_site_monitor_logs.bat - A Windows batch file to prune the log files
* stdout.txt           - An auto-generated output file containing the text normally sent to STDOUT and STDERR
* SiteMonitor.log      - An auto-generated output file containing information recorded by the script.
* site_monitor_data.xls - A Microsoft Excel workbook containing the data (URL's, Email info), for the site monitor
* example_stdout.txt       -  Example stdout.txt file from a run with Google & Yahoo passing & 1 failure
* example_site_monitor.log -  Example of the site_monitor.log file from a run with Google & Yahoo passing & 1 failure
* example_email.txt        -  Example email sent from that failure

=== Setup:

1. The system running the Site Monitor needs Ruby, Watir and WatirWorks properly installed
2. Copy the files in WatirWork's site_monitor folder to a writable directory on the local file system. For example:
           C:\WINDOWS\temp\SiteMonitor\
3. Modify the site_monitor_data.xls with information specific to your environment:
   * The URL's of the Web Sites to monitor
   * The email addresses to notify if a monitored site is inaccessible
	* The information necessary for your SMTP server to send email.
4. (Optional) Create a Scheduled Tasks to run the batch file (see below).
5. Periodically prune the output files stdout.txt, and site_monitor.log, so that they don't fill up the file system!
