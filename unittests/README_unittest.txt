This is the unittest suite for WatirWorks.

It's intended for use by the WatirWorks Development team to test new releases of WatirWorks, but if you'd like to run the test suite yourself you can.

The individual test files are named in the form of: "xxx_unittest.rb". 
To run a particular test case, type:
    ruby xxx_unittest.rb

The test suite file is named: watirworks_unittest_testsuite.rb 
To run the entire suite of test cases, type:
    ruby watirworks_unittest_testsuite.rb

In either case scan the results for any failures.
