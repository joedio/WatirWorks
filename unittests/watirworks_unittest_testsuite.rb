# Description:  This script performs the following:
#                    a) Defines global variables shared among the tests in this testsuite.
#                    b) Starts a log file that's shared among the tests in this testsuite.
#                    c) Starting at the directory where this file resides it transverses the directory and
#                       its sub-directory tree collecting an alpha sorted list (a-z) of test files
#                       (files ending in *_unittest.rb) and then executes each test file.
#
# Instructions: 1. Copy this file into the parent directory containing your test files
#               2. Edit the global variable definitions in this file as needed for the test run
#               3. Execute this file (see details below).
#
# Execution:   To run your Testsuite (e.g. Testsuite.rb):
#                 a) From ScITE:
#                      1. Open your Testsuite.rb in ScITE (Right click on the .rb file & select Edit)
#                      2. From the ScITE tool select Tools > Go  or press F5
#                 b) From a DOS Command Console window:
#                      1. Change directory (cd) to the location of your Testsuite.rb
#                      2. To run and re-direct stdout (1) & stderr (2) to a text file:
#                              ruby Testsuite.rb >> stdout.txt 2>&1
#                 c) From an Cygwin window:
#                      1. Change directory (cd) to the location of your Testsuite.rb
#                      2. To run in the background and re-direct stdout ($1) & stderr ($2) to a text file:
#                               ruby Testsuite.rb $1$2 >> stdout.txt &
#
# Analysis:       View the contents of the time-stamped logfile (that will be created in
#                 the ./results sub-directory), and the stdout for any failures.
#
#                 Note: If the Testsuite or individual Test files re-run the previous results directory will
#                       be renamed with an appended time-stamped.
#
#
# Restrictions:
#                Neither this file, the *_test.rb nor  the *_lib.rb files may reside at the top
#                level of the file system.
#
#                Only Testsuite files should end with _testuite.rb
#                Only Test files should end with _test.rb
#
#                Test files must reside in the same directory or a sub-directory of their testsuite file.
#                Test files must end with _test.rb in order to be included for execution in the testsuite.
#
#                Individual test files should NOT open their Browser of Log file directly, but
#                should use the methods startBrowser() or startLogger(). This will ensure that the tests
#                can be run either collectively as a part of a testsuite, or individually apart of a testsuite,
#                and still have access to a log file, and a single results sub-directory.
#
#                Individual test files should NOT CLOSE the log file!
#
#                Individual test files should inherit the settings of any global variables
#                from the testsuite that launched them.
